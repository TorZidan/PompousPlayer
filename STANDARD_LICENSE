Copyright (c) 2020 Pompous Media LLC

The gist of it, in plain english:
You may use the code at no charge in commercial or non-commercial apps, 
web sites, games, components, and other software as long as end users are not
charged a fee of any kind to use your product or to gain access to any part of
it. If your end users are charged a usage/access/subscription/license fee,
please sign up for a comprehensive commercial fee-based license by emailing us
at support@pompousphotos.com. See 
https://www.pompousphotos.com/commercial_license for details.
Use at your own risk. No warranties are offered.
Please respect the copyright.

Legal:
This is a legal agreement between you (referred as "YOU", "YOUR" below), either
an individual or a single entity, and Pompous Media LLC (referred below as 
"WE", "US", "OUR"), for the proprietary code known as Pompous Player,
available for download at https://github.com/TorZidan/PompousPlayer and 
at other locations; this code and documentation, as well as any updates, 
are referred to in this Agreement as the "PROGRAM". 
By downloading, copying, or otherwise using the PROGRAM, YOU agree to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. If YOU do not agree to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, please do not download or use the PROGRAM.


I. LICENSE
A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WE hereby grant YOU
a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable right to use the PROGRAM in apps,
web sites, games, components thereof and other software applications 
(collectively referred below as "DEVELOPED WORK"), for which the end
user is NOT charged any fees. If YOU would like to use the code in a
DEVELOPED WORK for which end users are charged a fee 
(either for usage or access or subscription), simply sign up for OUR 
comprehensive commercial license; see 
https://www.pompousphotos.com/commercial_license for details.


II. LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS
A. YOU agree that YOU will not sell, rent, or license the PROGRAM's source code
or any derivative works thereof to any third party without OUR prior written
consent. Distribution of the PROGRAM as part of YOUR DEVELOPED WORK is
acceptable so long as it is used exclusively as a part of YOUR DEVELOPED WORK.
YOU agree not to modify or delete OUR existing copyright notices located in the
source code.

B. YOU may use, duplicate, and distribute the compiled object code as embedded
in DEVELOPED WORK created by YOU, either for YOUR own use or for distribution
to a third party so long as end users of the DEVELOPED WORK are not charged a
fee for usage of or access to any portion of the DEVELOPED WORK. 

C. YOU may make modifications to the source code exclusively for YOUR own use
in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the
PROGRAM as originally intended.


III. CONSIDERATION
A. The license rights granted to YOU under this Agreement are at no charge, but
only in the following circumstances: If on YOUR own behalf or on behalf of a
third party YOU incorporate the PROGRAM into YOUR DEVELOPED WORK, which in the
case of a web site, must be accessible to Internet users without payment of a
fee of any kind, and in the case of a software application, game, program or
component, neither YOU nor anyone to whom YOU distribute the DEVELOPED WORK
charges a user a fee of any kind to use such DEVELOPED WORK or application,
game, program or component into which such DEVELOPED WORK is embedded. The
foregoing shall apply regardless of whether YOU are paid to create such
DEVELOPED WORK.

B. In the event YOUR intended use of the PROGRAM does not meet the criteria for
the "no charge" license rights set forth in the immediately preceding 
paragraph, then YOU are not licensed to use the PROGRAM under this Agreement,
and YOU must license the PROGRAM under OUR separate commercial, fee-based
Software License Agreement; see 
https://www.pompousphotos.com/commercial_license for more details. 

C. YOU may make modifications to the source code exclusively for YOUR own use
in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the
PROGRAM as originally intended.


IV. TITLE AND OWNERSHIP
The PROGRAM is licensed, not sold, and is protected by copyright laws and
international treaty provisions. YOU acknowledge that no title to the
intellectual property in the PROGRAM is transferred to YOU. YOU further
acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the PROGRAM, including all
intellectual property rights therein, will remain OUR exclusive property, and
YOU will not acquire any rights to the PROGRAM except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement. YOU agree that any copies of the PROGRAM YOU make will
contain the same proprietary notices which appear on and in the PROGRAM. 
YOU agree that WE may identify YOU as a licensee unless YOU make a written
request otherwise. WE hereby grant to YOU the right to disclose that YOUR
DEVELOPED WORK makes use of OUR code (for example, "Powered by Pompous 
Player").


V. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
A. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT
THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT
OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. WE shall not be liable for
special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages with respect to any
claim on account of or arising from this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM, even
if WE have been or are hereafter advised of the possibility of such damages.
Because some states do not allow certain exclusions or limitations on implied
warranties or of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above
exclusions may not apply to YOU. In no event, however, will WE be liable to YOU,
under any theory of recovery, in an amount in excess of $250. Notwithstanding
anything else in this agreement, YOU agree to indemnify US, OUR assignees, and
licensees, and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all claims,
losses, damages, and expenses, including legal fees arising out of or resulting
from any negligent act or omission by YOU.

B. WE may, at OUR sole discretion, provide support services related to the
PROGRAM, but WE have no obligation to do so.


VI. TERMINATION
If YOU at any time fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement, WE shall have
the right to immediately terminate the license granted herein and pursue any
other legal or equitable remedies available.


VII. MISCELLANEOUS
A. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State 
of Delaware. In the event of any dispute between YOU and US with respect to
this Agreement, we both agree that if we cannot resolve the dispute in good
faith discussion, either of us may submit the dispute for resolution to
arbitration with the American Arbitration Association before a single
arbitrator using the AAA Rules for Commercial Arbitration. The arbitrator's
decision is final and can be enforced in any court with jurisdiction over such
matters.

B. This agreement represents the complete and exclusive statement of the
agreement between US and YOU and supersedes all prior agreements, proposals,
representations and other communications, verbal or written, between them with
respect to use of the program. This agreement may be modified only with the
mutual written approval of authorized representatives of the parties.

C. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any
different, conflicting, or additional terms or conditions which may appear in
any purchase order or other document submitted by YOU. YOU agree that such
additional or inconsistent terms are deemed rejected by US.
